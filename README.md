# Panintelligence Technical Test

The brief for this technical test is as follows:

> Please build a single page web application using a framework of your choice.
> Data in the application must be stored in a database. The application can be as simple as a to-do list, or something more imaginative that demonstrates something that interests you.
>
> The application must be able to read and display data from a database.
>
> The application must be able to update data in the database.
>
> The application must be deployed by means of infrastructure as code.
>
> The application deploy process could be handled using a ci/cd pipeline.
>
> Future upgrades to the application should be considered when updating the code base (how are these changes rolled out to a deployed application)

## Structure

This repository contains three main directories:

- frontend - This is where the code for the frontend is contained.
- backend - This is where the code for the backend and databased is contained.
- infrastructure - This is where the infrastructure as code is written, which will provision the cloud infrastructure to host the application.
